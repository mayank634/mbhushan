## About

Hello there! My name is Mayank Bhushan and I am a data enthusiast from India. I graduated in Information Systems from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad in 2016. Whilst pursuing my degree, I developed a keen interest in data analytics and chose to pursue it as a career. I have been working in this field for a year and a half now. I am particularly interesed in the field of data visualization. The power to compress complex datasets into approachable and even appealing graphics is fascinating. The craft of shaping data to perfectly fit into the interface of our visual processing systems. The sheer wonder of being able to squeeze thousands of data points into a picture most of us are intuitively able to grasp. The purpose of this blog is to chronicle my voyage into the proverbial sea of data visualization.
